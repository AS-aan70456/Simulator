The genetic algorithm works as follows:
- at the beginning, an initial population of possible solutions is created,
- then a selection of the best solutions is made,
- a check is made, if the result is not achieved,
- then based on the selection of decisions,
- the former of the new generation,
- the new generation again goes through the selection.
